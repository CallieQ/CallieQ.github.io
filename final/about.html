                <p id='definitionWord'>The term “meditation” refers to a variety of practices that focus on mind and body integration
                 and are used to calm the mind and enhance overall well-being. Some types of meditation involve maintaining mental
                  focus on a particular sensation, such as breathing, a sound, a visual image, or a mantra, which is a repeated word 
                  or phrase. Other forms of meditation include the practice of mindfulness, which involves maintaining attention or 
                  awareness on the present moment without making judgments.<p>

                improve the quality of their lives. Recent studies have investigated if meditation or mindfulness helps people manage 
                anxiety, stress, depression, pain, or symptoms related to withdrawal from nicotine, alcohol, or opioids. Other studies 
                have looked at the effects of meditation or mindfulness on weight control or sleep quality. <p>

                        depression examined mindfulness meditation approaches compared with no treatment and with established evidence-based 
                        treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressant medications. The analysis included more than 12,000 
                        participants, and the researchers found that for treating anxiety and depression, mindfulness-based approaches were better
                        than no treatment at all, and they worked as well as the evidence-based therapies.

                            were no different than those of evidence-based treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise.
